# TravelWay

## Overview

TravelWay is a React.js project designed for creating and managing packing lists for travel. It allows you to list items and their quantities, and you can mark items as packed or not. When an item is marked as packed, it visually shows a checkmark by striking through the item.

## Features

- **Item Management:** Create a list of travel items, specifying quantities.

- **Sorting Options:** Sort items by Order, Description, or Packed status (checked or unchecked).

- **Clear List:** Confirm before clearing the entire list to avoid accidental deletions.

- **Conditional Messages:**

  - If the list is empty: "Start adding some items to your packing list 🚵".
  - If there are items: Display the count and percentage of packed items.

- **Completion Message:** "You got everything! Ready to go 👋 ✈️" when all items are packed.

## Structure

The project is organized with each component in separate files for better organization.

## Local Storage

The packing list is stored in local storage, making it dynamic and realistic for a small-scale application.
